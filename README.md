# TheHungerLegionsWebsite

## Project Overview

This website was created for a noble cause: the abolition of hunger. The main idea behind this website was to collect leftover food from restaurants and distribute it to those in need.

The following ppt explains how this entire project works: https://www.canva.com/design/DAE4umyrSdo/PRooBch5jP30RowwnnF1xw/view?utm_content=DAE4umyrSdo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink#12 

The website currently only has the front-end and is operational: https://jolly-mayer-f6a2a5.netlify.app/ 

I'm working on this website to provide a back-end and am openly accepting contributions.
